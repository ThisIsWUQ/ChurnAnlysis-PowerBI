# ChurnAnlysis-PowerBI
Analysis and visualization of customer churn mocked-up data using Power BI. A project assignment of DataCamp's [Case Study: Analyzing Customer Churn in Power BI](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/case-study-analyzing-customer-churn-in-power-bi)

The analyses shown in the dashboard says the current churn rate is 26.86%. The rate suggests to us that:

* The reasons of the customer churn can be categorized into main three categories: 1) competitor 2) attitude and 3) dissatisfaction. The improvement in marketing and service quality should be made.
* The churn occurs in the customers who have month-to-month contract type (about half of all customers) especially those who pay with debit or credit card. Further research of how this group of customers consume should be conducted.
* Those customers who have high monthly charge tend to churn. Discounts or decrease in the charge should be provided to retain the customers.
* While California has the highest customer service calls, it also has the highest churn rate. This suggests that there should be improvement in the customer service.
